    > Caution: this command is specific to the GNU versions of [_sed_](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/sed.1.html) and [_date_](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/date.1.html) (doesn't work with the corresponding BSD versions).

    The command converts the value of `key:` in a YAML file from a UNIX timestamp to a [ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) formatted date.

    Explanations:

    - The `-E` option of _sed_ enables the extended regex format and is necessary to correctly recognise the provided regex.
    - The `e` modifier in `s///e` causes the replacement pattern to be executed as a shell command. The output of this shell command becomes the actual replacement string.
    - For the _date_ invocation, see [[convert-timestamp-to-iso-8601-gnu-date]].

    The gist of this command is that the `s///e` modifier allows _sed_ capture groups to be passed to shell commands to further process them before inserting them in the output.
